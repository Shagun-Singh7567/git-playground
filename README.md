# Git-playground
This is my first playground repo to learn how things work around here. I love coding in Java, and this repo will hold some of my first few java projects focusing on object oriented programming.

## What's in here?
- My first github file
- Basic java projects
---
## Goals
- Learning the basics of version control
- Figuring out how github works
- Showing off my very basic java skills at this point
Also, the green box on my profile to show if I've commited today is a new dopamine boost altogether lol
